/// A collection of HTTP headers.
///
/// Usage
/// -----
///
/// The primary methods you will care about are:
///
/// Typed header access
/// ```````````````````
///
/// Unlike most HTTP libraries, this one cares about correctness and strong typing; headers are
/// semantically typed values, not just sequences of characters. This may lead to some surprises for
/// people used to other environments. For example, you might think that the `Connection` header is
/// a scalar, having seen it with the value `close` most frequently when present; therefore you
/// might expect to check `*request.headers.get_ref(CONNECTION) == Close`. Well, it's not: it's
/// actually a linear value, `Vec<Connection>` instead of `Connection`, so you'll actually be
/// wanting to check something more like `request.headers.get_ref(CONNECTION).map(|c|
/// c.contains(&Close)) == Some(true)`. Yes, this is more cumbersome than what you might write in
/// another language, such as `request.headers["Connection"] == "close"`, but it's actually correct,
/// whereas the one people would often write is very definitely incorrect.
///
/// There are four methods for this:
///
/// - `get`: cloned value, if it exists.
/// - `get_ref`: reference to the value, if it exists.
/// - `get_mut_ref`: mutable reference to the value, if it exists.
/// - `set`: assign the value.
///
/// One thing out of the ordinary to be aware of is that all of these methods take `&mut self`, even
/// `get` and `get_ref`; this is not ideal, but it is thus for a very good reason, an outcome of the
/// hybrid typed/raw approach employed. The main practial effect of this is that you cannot take
/// references to more than one header at once; where possible, use `get_ref`, but it is
/// acknowledged that it will not always be feasible to use it: this is why `get` exists, which
/// clones the value, thus releasing the lock on the header collection.
///
/// Raw header access
/// `````````````````
///
/// Largely you should prefer typed access, but sometimes raw header access is convenient or even
/// necessary.
///
/// There are again four methods for this, corresponding to the typed techniques:
///
/// - `get_raw`: cloned value, if it exists.
/// - `get_raw_ref`: reference to the value, if it exists.
/// - `get_raw_mut_ref`: mutable reference to the value, if it exists.
/// - `set_raw`: assign the value.
///
/// Aside: what is a header?
/// ------------------------
///
/// When we speak of a header in this library, we are not referring to the HTTP concept of a *header
/// field*; we are dealing with a slightly higher abstraction than that.
///
/// In HTTP/1.1, a message header is defined like this (RFC 2616, section 4.2 Message Headers):
///
///         message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
///         field-name     = token
///         field-value    = *( field-content | LWS )
///         field-content  = <the OCTETs making up the field-value
///                          and consisting of either *TEXT or combinations
///                          of token, separators, and quoted-string>
///
/// This is something all web developers should be at least basically familiar with.
///
/// The interesting part comes a little later in that section and is to do with how message headers
/// *combine*:
///
///     Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be
///     present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that
///     header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].
///     It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one
///     "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the
///     message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each
///     separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same
///     field-name are received is therefore significant to the
///     interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT
///     change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.
///
/// In this library, what we call a header is not a single message header, but rather the
/// combination of all message headers with the same field name; that is, a field-name plus *all*
/// related field-values. One can still access them separately through the raw interface, but the
/// preferred technique is accessing them through the typed interface, where all such
/// identically-named message headers will be merged.
///
/// Representation
/// --------------
///
/// A knowledge of how headers are represented internally may assist you in using them efficiently.
///
/// Headers are stored in a hash map; the keys are header names and the values are what for the
/// purpose of this description will be dubbed *items*.
///
/// At this point it is worth recalling that in a request or response, there can be multiple header
/// fields with the same name; this is why the raw representation of each header item is `Vec<Vec<u8>>`
/// rather than `Vec<u8>` each header field can 
/// Each header name is thus associated with an
/// item.
